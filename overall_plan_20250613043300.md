## Screen Framer Tauri App Plan

### Framer - An app to allow someone with a large screen to add a frame window on the screen to delineate where the screen capture (e.g. with OBS) is happening.

The idea behind this framer app is to create a frame to be always visible and on top of everything else, so that someone doing a video screen capture with a large monitor can always see the actual capture area. 

- **Project Setup:** - Done
    - Set up a Git repo on Github - Done
    - Initialize a new Rust project using Cargo. - Done
    - Add Tauri as a dependency to your Rust project. - Done
    - Set up your frontend framework (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue) within the designated `src-tauri/src` directory. - Done

- **Tauri Configuration (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`):** - Done
    - Configure the main Tauri window to be `decorations: false` (no OS border), `transparent: true` (transparent background), and `alwaysOnTop: true` (stays above other apps). - Done
    - Point the `frontendDist` path to your compiled frontend assets (e.g., a `dist` folder after a build step). - Done

- **Main Rust Process (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`):**
    - Initialize the Tauri application.  - Done
    - Set up event handlers or custom commands if needed for advanced backend interactions.  - Done
    - (For this app, most logic will be in the frontend, so `main.rs` will be relatively minimal beyond basic setup).  - Done

- **Frontend UI (`src/index.html`):**
    - Define a main `div` element (e.g., `<div id="framer-main"></div>`) to represent the visible screen frame.  - Done
    - Inside or around the main frame `div`, add smaller `div` elements to serve as clickable/draggable resize handles (e.g., for corners and mid-sides).  - Done

- **Frontend Styling (`src/style.css`):  - Done
    - Apply `background-color: transparent;` to `html` and `body` to ensure the window's underlying area is invisible.  - Done
    - Style the main frame `div` with a visible border (e.g., `dashed`) and a semi-transparent background color. - Done
    - Style the resize handle `div`s with appropriate dimensions, background, and specific `cursor` types for each direction. - Done

- **Frontend Logic (`src/renderer.js` or your framework's equivalent):**
    - Implement a `mousedown` event listener on the `document.body` to start drawing a new frame. - Done
    - Implement `mousemove` while drawing to dynamically update the frame's size and position based on mouse movement. - Done
    - Implement `mouseup` to finalize the drawn frame. - Done
    - Attach `mousedown` listeners to the resize handles to initiate resizing. - Done
    - Implement `mousemove` during resizing to calculate and apply new dimensions/positions based on mouse movement and the active handle. - Done
    - Add conditional logic to the resize `mousemove` handler to apply proportional scaling when the `Ctrl` key is pressed. - Done
    - Implement `mousedown` on the frame itself (excluding handles) to enable dragging (moving) the entire frame. - Done
    - Implement `mousemove` during dragging to update the frame's `left` and `top` CSS properties. - Done
    - Implement `mouseup` to end dragging or resizing. - Done
    - Use Tauri's frontend API (`@tauri-apps/api/window` if needed for runtime window control, though initial settings are via `tauri.conf.json`).

### Next Steps / Phase 2 Features

1.  **Main Framer Window Fullscreen:**
    *   Modify `tauri.conf.json` to make the main transparent window `fullscreen: true`.
2.  **Dedicated Control Window:**
    *   Create a new, small, non-transparent Tauri window to act as a control panel.
    *   Implement an "On/Off" switch in the control window to toggle the visibility of the main drawing frame (`#framer-main` div).
    *   Add a configuration (e.g., cog icon with dropdown) in the control window to allow users to set its position on the screen (e.g., top-center, top-right, bottom-left).
    *   Persist control window position preference (e.g., using `tauri-plugin-store`).
3.  **Preset Frame Sizes:**
    *   Add UI in the control window for selecting preset frame sizes (e.g., Full HD 1920x1080, HD 1280x720).
    *   Implement logic to apply these presets to the main drawing frame.

- **Distribution:**
    - Use Tauri's built-in `cargo tauri build` command.
    - Configure `tauri.conf.json` for target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) to generate native installers/executables. - Done (Bundle ID updated)

### Suggested Future Enhancements (Broader List)

*   **Multiple Frames:** Enable the creation and management of multiple independent frames.
    *   *(Considered a more significant architectural change for a later phase)*
*   **Customizable Frame Appearance:** Allow users to change the frame's color, border style (solid, dashed), thickness, and opacity.
*   **Aspect Ratio Display/Lock:** Display the current aspect ratio of the frame and offer an option to lock it to common ratios (e.g., 16:9, 4:3).
*   **Dimension Display:** Show the exact pixel dimensions (width x height) and screen coordinates (X, Y) of the frame.
*   **Hotkeys & Shortcuts:** Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions like toggling frame visibility, resetting the frame, or initiating a new frame draw.
*   **Snap-to-Grid/Window:** Add functionality to snap the frame to a customizable grid or align it with the edges of other active windows.
*   **Basic Settings UI:** A small, non-intrusive settings panel for managing customization options.
*   **System Tray Integration:** Provide an icon in the system tray (or menu bar on macOS) for quick access to app controls.
