# Framer App - Documentation

Welcome to the Framer App documentation. Here you'll find information on how to install and use the application.

## Installation

### Windows

1.  **Download:**
    *   Download the latest installer (`.msi`) from the Homepage. <!-- Update with link to homepage download section -->
    *   Alternatively, get Framer from the Microsoft Store (link coming soon!).
2.  **Run Installer:** Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen prompts.

*(Instructions for macOS and Linux will be added here once packages are available)*

## Basic Usage

1.  **Launching Framer:**
    *   After installation, you can find and launch Framer from your Start Menu (Windows) or application launcher.
    *   The application will start with a default frame (e.g., 1920x1080) and the controls area visible.

2.  **Toggling Interactivity (Click-Through Mode):**
    *   Press **`Ctrl + F9`** to toggle the application's interactivity.
    *   **Interactive Mode (Green Light):** The frame and controls are clickable. You can drag and resize the frame. Clicks do not pass through the transparent areas of the app.
    *   **Click-Through Mode (Red Light):** The entire Framer application becomes unresponsive to mouse clicks, allowing you to interact with applications underneath it. The frame remains visible.

3.  **Interacting with the Frame (in Interactive Mode):**
    *   **Dragging:** Click and drag anywhere on the frame's border or inside it to move it.
    *   **Resizing:** Click and drag any of the handles (small squares at the corners and sides of the frame) to resize it.

4.  **Using the Controls Area:**
    *   **Status Light:** Shows the current interactivity state (Green = Interactive, Red = Click-Through).
    *   **Presets Menu (`+` icon):** Apply predefined screen sizes or select "Custom Size..."
    *   **Frame Toggle:** Turn the visual frame on or off.
    *   **Settings Menu (Gear icon):** Access "About Framer" and "System Info" dialogs.
    *   **Close Button (`X` icon):** Exits the Framer application.

## Tips & Tricks

### Frame Rendering on Virtual Desktops (Windows)

Windows has a built-in setting that allows an application window to appear on all virtual desktops, effectively "sticking with" the user no matter which desktop they are currently on. This can be very useful for Framer.

**Here's how you can achieve this:**

1.  **Open Task View:** You can do this by clicking the "Task View" icon on your taskbar (it looks like two overlapping squares) or by pressing **`Windows key + Tab`**.

2.  **Locate the Framer window:** In the Task View, you'll see thumbnails of all your open windows and your virtual desktops (usually at the top or bottom of the screen).

3.  **Right-click the Framer window:** Right-click on the thumbnail of the Framer application window.

4.  **Select "Show this window on all desktops":** From the context menu that appears, select this option.

Once you've done this, the Framer window will be visible and accessible regardless of which virtual desktop you switch to. You may need to re-apply this setting if you close and reopen Framer.
