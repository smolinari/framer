App Features:

* **Click-and-Drag Frame Creation:** Users can click and drag on the screen to define the initial size and position of a capture frame. This may involve a hotkey combination to temporarily disable click-through and allow the window to capture mouse events for drawing.
* **Always-On-Top Persistence:** Once created, the frame remains visible on the screen and stays above all other application windows.
* **Resizable Frame:** The frame's dimensions can be adjusted by dragging its sides and corners.
* **Proportional Scaling:** Holding the 'Ctrl' key during resizing will proportionally scale the entire frame, maintaining its aspect ratio.
* **Draggable Frame:** The entire frame can be moved to a new position on the screen by clicking and dragging its interior.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The application will run seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

Suggested Future Enhancements:

* **Customizable Frame Appearance:** Allow users to change the frame's color, border style (solid, dashed), thickness, and opacity.
* **User-Selectable Colors with Local Storage:** Provide a UI (e.g., pulldown or color picker) for users to choose their own colors for elements like the frame and handles. Store these choices locally so they persist across application restarts.
* **Aspect Ratio Display/Lock:** Display the current aspect ratio of the frame and offer an option to lock it to common ratios (e.g., 16:9, 4:3).
* **Dimension Display:** Show the exact pixel dimensions (width x height) and screen coordinates (X, Y) of the frame.
* **Multiple Frames/Presets:** Enable the creation and management of multiple independent frames, or save/load frame position/size presets.
* **Hotkeys & Shortcuts:** Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions like toggling frame visibility, resetting the frame, or initiating a new frame draw.
* **Snap-to-Grid/Window:** Add functionality to snap the frame to a customizable grid or align it with the edges of other active windows.
* **Basic Settings UI:** A small, non-intrusive settings panel for managing customization options.
* **System Tray Integration:** Provide an icon in the system tray (or menu bar on macOS) for quick access to app controls.
